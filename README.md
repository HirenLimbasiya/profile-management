# Profile Management Application

This project is a **profile management system** that allows users to create, view, update, and delete their profiles. The application is built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with **Axios** for making API requests and **JSON-server** for simulating a backend.

## Description

- **Create a Profile**: Fill out the profile form with your **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Age**, and **Email**.
- **View Profile**: After submission, you'll be redirected to a profile view page to see the details you entered.
- **Update/Delete Profile**: Return to the form to update or delete the profile as needed.

The project also includes features like **local storage** for persistence and a **theme toggle** (light/dark mode) for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
- **TypeScript** (for type safety and better development experience)
- **Axios** (for making HTTP requests)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **JSON-server** (for simulating a REST API backend)

### Future Enhancements

- **Admin Login**: An admin panel to manage multiple user profiles, with the ability to view, update, or delete user accounts.
